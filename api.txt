# # Example of this module in use.

# # This is a tool used to scrape the brainyquote.com page for quotes based on the specified category 
# # It returns a randomised quote based on the maximum page you want the scraping tool to go through
# # An example of this tool in action would be this
# quote = quoteCall(category()[79], 3) # This would return the randomised quote from the specified category given by category()[79]

# # This function returns a list of all categories on the website and when you call the quoteCall and use category()[*index value*] then it uses the specified category according to its index value in the list
# categories = category()
